================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The code imports third-party libraries without any form of integrity check. This can lead to a situation where malicious code is unintentionally imported and executed, leading to various security risks such as data breaches and remote code execution.
Solution: Ensure that all third-party libraries are downloaded from trusted sources and their integrity is checked using checksums or similar mechanisms.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The code uses a GET request to retrieve data from the repository. This can lead to information leakage as the parameters of a GET request are included in the URL and can be logged by various systems or exposed through browser history.
Solution: Change the GET request to a POST request or encrypt sensitive data before sending it as part of a GET request.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code does not handle exceptions, so unhandled exceptions may be returned to the user, exposing sensitive information or system details that can be exploited.
Solution: Add exception handling to the code to catch and handle potential exceptions. Ensure that error messages returned to the user do not contain sensitive information or system details.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The code does not appear to have any CSRF protections in place. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into making an authenticated request to the application, leading to potential unauthorized actions.
Solution: Implement CSRF protections, such as synchronizer token pattern or double submit cookies. Consider using security features provided by frameworks or libraries.

1. **Scenario: Test to check if the function returns all screens**  
   This scenario validates if the function can successfully retrieve all the screens from the repository.

2. **Scenario: Test for an empty repository**  
   This scenario validates the function's behavior when the repository is empty. The function should return an empty list.

3. **Scenario: Test for a null repository**  
   This scenario validates the function's behavior when the repository is null. The function should handle this gracefully, either by returning an empty list or throwing an exception.

4. **Scenario: Test for the type of returned objects**  
   This scenario validates that the function returns a list of Screen objects as expected. If any other type is returned, the test should fail.

5. **Scenario: Test for the sequence of returned screens**  
   This scenario validates whether the function returns the screens in the correct sequence as they are stored in the repository.

6. **Scenario: Test for duplicate screens in the returned list**  
   This scenario validates whether the function handles duplicates in the repository. Depending on the business logic, it should either return duplicates or filter them out.

7. **Scenario: Test for the number of returned screens**  
   This scenario validates whether the function returns the correct number of screens. The number of returned screens should match the number of screens in the repository.

8. **Scenario: Test for the function's behavior with large data sets**  
   This scenario validates whether the function can handle large data sets efficiently. The function should not crash or become unresponsive when the repository contains a large number of screens.

9. **Scenario: Test for the function's behavior during concurrent access**  
   This scenario validates whether the function can handle multiple concurrent requests. The function should return correct results even when accessed simultaneously from different threads or processes.

10. **Scenario: Test for the function's behavior when the repository throws an exception**  
    This scenario validates how the function handles exceptions thrown by the repository. The function should either catch and handle the exception or propagate it to the caller.
