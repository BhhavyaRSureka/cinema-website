To validate the business logic of the `getAllScreens` method, we can write the following test scenarios without actual test code:

1. **Successful Retrieval Test:**
   - Scenario: Retrieve all screens when there are multiple screens present in the database.
   - Expected Result: The method should return a list containing all the screens from the repository.

2. **Empty Repository Test:**
   - Scenario: Retrieve all screens when the database is empty.
   - Expected Result: The method should return an empty list, indicating there are no screens to display.

3. **Repository Error Handling Test:**
   - Scenario: Attempt to retrieve all screens when the repository encounters an error (e.g., database connection issue).
   - Expected Result: The method should handle the error gracefully, potentially throwing a custom exception or returning an error code/message.

4. **Order and Integrity Test:**
   - Scenario: Check the order and integrity of the returned screen list.
   - Expected Result: The list of screens returned should be in the same order as in the repository and contain all the expected attributes without corruption or alteration.

5. **Performance Test:**
   - Scenario: Retrieve all screens under high load or when there is a large number of screens in the repository.
   - Expected Result: The method should perform within acceptable time limits and not cause timeouts or significant performance degradation.

6. **Authorization Test (if applicable):**
   - Scenario: Retrieve all screens with a user who may or may not have the necessary permissions to view all screens.
   - Expected Result: If authorization is required, the method should only return screens to authorized users. If an unauthorized user attempts to access, it should deny the request.

7. **Data Type and Structure Validation Test:**
   - Scenario: Validate the data types and structure of the Screen objects in the returned list.
   - Expected Result: Each Screen object in the list should adhere to the expected data structure and types defined in the Screen class.

8. **Concurrent Access Test:**
   - Scenario: Multiple users or services call getAllScreens simultaneously.
   - Expected Result: The method should be able to handle concurrent requests and return the correct screen list to each caller without any data inconsistency.

9. **Caching Behavior Test (if caching is implemented):**
   - Scenario: Retrieve all screens when caching is enabled, and ensure the cache is used appropriately.
   - Expected Result: The method should return screens from the cache when available and only query the repository when necessary (e.g., on cache miss or expiration).

10. **Integration with Frontend Test (if applicable):**
    - Scenario: The front end makes a request to the backend to retrieve all screens.
    - Expected Result: The backend should provide a response that the front end can successfully parse and use to display screen information.

11. **Handle Repository Pagination (if applicable):**
    - Scenario: Repository implements pagination but the getAllScreens method is expected to return all records.
    - Expected Result: The method should handle pagination internally, potentially iterating through pages if necessary, to return a complete list of screens.

12. **Screen Object Validation Test:**
    - Scenario: Validate that all Screen objects returned by the method have valid and non-null fields as required by the business logic.
    - Expected Result: No Screen object in the returned list should have null or invalid fields that would violate business rules.

Please note that these test scenarios are high-level descriptions and would need to be translated into actual test cases with specific assertions and validation points.
