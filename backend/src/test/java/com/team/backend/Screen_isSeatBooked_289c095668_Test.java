================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: Java applications that interact with databases are susceptible to SQL injection attacks when they use concatenated strings to build SQL queries instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities. Avoid building SQL queries by string concatenation.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: Java web applications can be susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which occur when untrusted data is included in a webpage without proper validation or escaping.
Solution: Ensure that data is properly validated, sanitized or escaped before it is included in a webpage. Consider using a library or framework that automatically escapes data.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Java applications can inadvertently expose sensitive information in error messages, logs, or through misconfigured access controls.
Solution: Ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive information, logs should be properly secured and access controls should be correctly configured.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: Java applications might expose critical functionality without proper authentication checks. This can allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions.
Solution: Ensure that all critical functionality requires proper authentication. Use a proven authentication framework instead of creating your own.

1. Scenario: Seat is not booked.
   Test Case: Invoke the isSeatBooked function when a seat is not booked. 
   Expected Result: The function should return false.

2. Scenario: Seat is booked.
   Test Case: Invoke the isSeatBooked function when a seat is already booked. 
   Expected Result: The function should return true.

3. Scenario: Multiple invocations of the function.
   Test Case: Invoke the isSeatBooked function multiple times for a seat, alternating between booked and not booked.
   Expected Result: The function should correctly return the current seat status each time it is invoked.

4. Scenario: Seat booking status change.
   Test Case: Invoke the isSeatBooked function before and after a seat booking status change.
   Expected Result: The function should correctly reflect the change in seat status.

5. Scenario: Concurrent invocations of the function.
   Test Case: Invoke the isSeatBooked function concurrently from multiple threads.
   Expected Result: The function should return correct seat status without any race conditions or inconsistent results.

6. Scenario: Null check.
   Test Case: Invoke the function when the seat object itself is null.
   Expected Result: As this function doesn't handle null checks, it would throw a NullPointerException. So, the method invoking this function should handle such scenarios.

7. Scenario: Seat booking status not initialized.
   Test Case: Invoke the function when the seatBooked status is not initialized.
   Expected Result: In Java, boolean variables are false by default. So, the function should return false.

Remember, these scenarios are specific to the function provided and does not consider other parts of a potential seat booking class or system.
