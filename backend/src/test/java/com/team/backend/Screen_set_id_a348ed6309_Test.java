================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Field (CWE-732)
Issue: The '_id' field appears to be an identifier for a database object. Having a public setter for this field could allow unauthorized modification of the identifier, which could lead to issues such as unauthorized access to data or corruption of data.
Solution: It is recommended to restrict the visibility of the setter method for sensitive fields. If external access to these fields is necessary, it should be controlled through methods that enforce appropriate security checks. The setter method for '_id' field should be made private or protected, and if external classes need to modify '_id', a public method that includes security checks should be used.

1. Scenario: Setting a valid ObjectId
   Test Case: Pass a valid ObjectId to the set_id method and verify that the _id has been set correctly.

2. Scenario: Setting a null ObjectId
   Test Case: Pass null as the ObjectId to the set_id method and verify that the _id is set to null.

3. Scenario: Setting an ObjectId when one already exists
   Test Case: Set an ObjectId, then set a different ObjectId, and verify that the original ObjectId has been replaced with the new one.

4. Scenario: Setting an ObjectId with an existing value
   Test Case: Set an ObjectId, then set the same ObjectId again, and verify that the _id remains the same and no errors are thrown.

5. Scenario: Setting an invalid ObjectId
   Test Case: Pass an invalid ObjectId (not following the structure of ObjectId) to the set_id method and verify that an error is thrown or handled properly.

6. Scenario: Setting an ObjectId of incorrect type
   Test Case: Pass an ObjectId of incorrect type (e.g., String, Integer) to the set_id method and verify that an error is thrown or handled properly.

7. Scenario: Concurrent setting of ObjectId
   Test Case: Attempt to set ObjectId from multiple threads concurrently and verify that the final _id is set correctly and no data corruption occurs.

8. Scenario: Setting an ObjectId with special characters
   Test Case: Pass an ObjectId with special characters to the set_id method and verify that an error is thrown or handled properly.

9. Scenario: Setting an ObjectId with maximum length
   Test Case: Pass an ObjectId with maximum allowed length to the set_id method and verify that the _id is set correctly.

10. Scenario: Setting an ObjectId with length exceeding the maximum limit
    Test Case: Pass an ObjectId with length exceeding the maximum limit to the set_id method and verify that an error is thrown or handled properly.
