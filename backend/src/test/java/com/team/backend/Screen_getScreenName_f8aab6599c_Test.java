================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The method `getScreenName()` does not have any access control, which means it can be accessed without any authentication. This can lead to information disclosure if sensitive information is returned by this method.
Solution: Implement access control mechanisms such as authentication and authorization on this method to prevent unauthorized access. Use Spring Security or similar libraries to achieve this.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code seems incomplete and might be part of a larger system. If this is debug code that was left in production, it could expose sensitive information or functionality.
Solution: Ensure that the code is complete and all debug code is removed before deploying to production.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: Data returned by `getScreenName()` method is not encrypted. If this data is sensitive, it may be exposed to attackers.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest using standard encryption algorithms such as AES. Java provides built-in support for many encryption algorithms through the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE).

1. Scenario: Check if the function returns the correct screenName
   Test Case: Assign a known value to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns the correct value.

2. Scenario: Check if the function handles null screenName properly
   Test Case: Assign null to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns null.

3. Scenario: Check if the function handles empty string as screenName correctly
   Test Case: Assign an empty string to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns an empty string.

4. Scenario: Check if the function handles white spaces in screenName properly
   Test Case: Assign a string with leading, trailing, or intermediate white spaces to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns the exact string including white spaces.

5. Scenario: Check if the function handles special characters in screenName correctly
   Test Case: Assign a string with special characters to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns the exact string including special characters.

6. Scenario: Check if the function handles very long screenNames correctly
   Test Case: Assign a very long string to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns the exact string.

7. Scenario: Check if the function handles numeric characters in screenName correctly
   Test Case: Assign a string containing numeric characters to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns the exact string including numeric characters.

8. Scenario: Check if the function handles non-English characters in screenName correctly
   Test Case: Assign a string with non-English characters to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns the exact string including non-English characters.

9. Scenario: Check if the function handles screenName with mixed character types correctly
   Test Case: Assign a string with a mixture of numeric, special, English, and non-English characters to screenName and verify that getScreenName() returns the exact string.
