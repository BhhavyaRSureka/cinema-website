Sure, here are some test scenarios that you can use to validate the business logic of this code snippet:

1. **Test Case 1:** Verify that the `users()` method returns a list of all users correctly.

    - **Steps:** Call the `users()` method.
    - **Expected Result:** The method should return a list of all users.

2. **Test Case 2:** Verify that the `users()` method returns an empty list when there are no users.

    - **Steps:** Clear the database of all users. Call the `users()` method.
    - **Expected Result:** The method should return an empty list.

3. **Test Case 3:** Verify that the `users()` method returns a list of users that includes a specific user.

    - **Steps:** Create a specific user in the database. Call the `users()` method.
    - **Expected Result:** The method should return a list that includes the specific user.

4. **Test Case 4:** Verify that the `users()` method does not return a user that is not in the database.

    - **Steps:** Create a specific user in the database. Delete the specific user from the database. Call the `users()` method.
    - **Expected Result:** The method should not return the specific user.

5. **Test Case 5:** Verify that the `users()` method returns a list of users sorted by username.

    - **Steps:** Create users with different usernames in the database. Call the `users()` method.
    - **Expected Result:** The method should return a list of users sorted by username.

Please note that these test cases assume that the `userService.getAllUsers()` method is correctly implemented to return all users from the database.
