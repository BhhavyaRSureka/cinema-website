Sure, here are some test scenarios you can use to validate the business logic of the `getAuthorities` method:

1. **Test with a user with no roles**

   Create a `User` object with no roles and call `getAuthorities`. The result should be an empty list.

2. **Test with a user with one role**

   Create a `User` object with one role and call `getAuthorities`. The result should be a list containing one `SimpleGrantedAuthority` object with the authority name corresponding to the role.

3. **Test with a user with multiple roles**

   Create a `User` object with multiple roles and call `getAuthorities`. The result should be a list containing `SimpleGrantedAuthority` objects with the authority names corresponding to the roles.

4. **Test with a user with duplicate roles**

   Create a `User` object with duplicate roles and call `getAuthorities`. The result should be a list containing `SimpleGrantedAuthority` objects with the authority names corresponding to the unique roles.

5. **Test with a user with null roles**

   Create a `User` object with null roles and call `getAuthorities`. The result should be an empty list.

6. **Test with a user with empty roles**

   Create a `User` object with empty roles and call `getAuthorities`. The result should be an empty list.

Remember to test all these scenarios and edge cases to ensure that your `getAuthorities` method is working correctly.
